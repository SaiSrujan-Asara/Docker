✅ Docker container unpause

docker container unpause resumes all processes in a paused container by sending the SIGCONT signal. 

This restores the container to its running state, exactly where it was before being paused.

⚠️ The container continues from the exact state it was in before pause. Any temporary suspension of CPU usage ends.

🔹 1. Basic Syntax

docker container unpause CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]

Shortcut:

docker unpause <container_name_or_id>

docker unpause is an alias for docker container unpause.

--
🔹 2. How It Works

Sends SIGCONT to all paused processes in the container

Processes resume execution exactly where they left off

Container returns to normal running state

CPU usage returns to normal, memory remains allocated

--
🔹 3. Examples

Example 1 — Unpause a single container

docker container unpause mynginx

Output:

mynginx

Container resumes from the paused state

--
Example 2 — Unpause multiple containers

docker container unpause mynginx myubuntu

Output:

mynginx
myubuntu

Batch resume of multiple paused containers

--
Example 3 — Verify container status

docker container ls

Output:

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     STATUS
c1b2d3e4f5g6   nginx     Up 2 hours

Previously paused container now shows Up, indicating it is running

--
🔹 4. Use Cases

Resume a container after temporary suspension

Example: Paused during high CPU usage, now resuming normal operation

Debugging / testing

Pause container to inspect its state, then unpause to continue

Automation scripts

Pause containers during certain operations, then unpause when ready

🔹 5. Differences from Stop / Restart / Pause

| Command   | Action                           | CPU Usage | Memory Usage    | Graceful Shutdown | Use Case                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `pause`   | Freeze container (SIGSTOP)       | 0         | Memory retained | ❌                 | Temporary suspension            |
| `unpause` | Resume container (SIGCONT)       | Normal    | Memory retained | ❌                 | Resume paused container         |
| `stop`    | Stop container (SIGTERM→SIGKILL) | 0         | 0               | ✅                 | Graceful termination            |
| `restart` | Stop then start container        | Normal    | Reset           | ✅                 | Quick recovery or apply changes |

---
🔹 6. Best Practices

Only unpause containers that were paused

Monitor container state with docker container ls before and after unpause

Combine pause/unpause for resource management or debugging workflows

Avoid unpausing containers in critical I/O operations if it could cause issues

🔹 7. Quick Reference Table

| Task                        | Command                                     | Notes                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Unpause a container         | `docker container unpause mynginx`          | Resumes all paused processes |
| Unpause multiple containers | `docker container unpause mynginx myubuntu` | Batch resume                 |
| Verify running state        | `docker container ls`                       | Status shows “Up”            |

✅ Summary:

docker container unpause = resume a previously paused container

Uses SIGCONT, processes continue from the paused state

CPU usage returns to normal; memory is preserved

Often used in conjunction with docker container pause for temporary suspension or resource management
