🔹 1. Basic Definition

docker image push is used to upload a Docker image from your local system to a Docker registry (like Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, Google Artifact Registry, Azure Container Registry, or private registries).

Tagging is required because registries identify images by repository name + tag.

Without a proper tag, the push will fail.

---
🔹 2. Basic Syntax

docker image push [OPTIONS] NAME[:TAG]

NAME[:TAG] → specifies the target repository and tag in the registry

OPTIONS are mostly related to authentication or disabling content trust

If TAG is omitted, Docker defaults to latest.

---
🔹 3. Authentication Requirement

Before pushing, you must log in to the registry:

docker login

Prompts for username and password (or token for some registries)

Example for Docker Hub:

docker login docker.io

---
🔹 4. Basic Example

Suppose you have an image tagged for Docker Hub:

docker image tag myapp:latest docker.io/johndoe/myapp:v1
docker image push docker.io/johndoe/myapp:v1


Output:

The push refers to repository [docker.io/johndoe/myapp]
d7b1a1234567: Pushed
...
v1: digest: sha256:abcdef12345 size: 1234

Layers are pushed one by one

Layers already present on the registry are skipped (thanks to caching)

---
🔹 5. How It Works Internally

Docker checks the image layers locally.

Compares with the registry:

If a layer already exists in the registry → skip upload

If a layer is missing → upload layer

Registry stores:

Image layers

Manifest (maps layers to tags)

After push, the image is available in the registry for others to pull.

This is why layer reuse is key to fast pushes.

| Option                    | Description                         | Example                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `--disable-content-trust` | Skip image signing verification     | `docker push --disable-content-trust myapp:latest` |
| `-q`                      | Quiet mode (only show image digest) | `docker push -q myapp:latest`                      |

Option	Default	   Description

-a,   --all-tags		Push all tags of an image to the repository

---
🔹 7. Detailed Examples

🧠 Example 1: Push latest tag to Docker Hub
docker image tag myapp:latest docker.io/johndoe/myapp:latest
docker image push docker.io/johndoe/myapp:latest

🧠 Example 2: Push versioned image
docker image tag myapp:latest docker.io/johndoe/myapp:v1.0.0
docker image push docker.io/johndoe/myapp:v1.0.0

🧠 Example 3: Push to private registry
docker login myregistry.company.com
docker image tag myapp:latest myregistry.company.com/myapp:prod
docker image push myregistry.company.com/myapp:prod

🧠 Example 4: Push multiple tags
docker image tag myapp:latest myapp:v1
docker image tag myapp:latest myapp:stable

docker push myapp:v1
docker push myapp:stable

Each tag is pushed individually even if they share layers.

🔹 8. Interview-Level Insights

Q1: Can you push an image without a tag?

No, Docker uses latest by default if tag is omitted.

Q2: What happens if a layer already exists in registry?

Docker skips that layer; only new layers are uploaded.

Q3: Why tagging is mandatory before pushing?

Registry uses repository:tag to identify images. Tag defines the “version” to push.

Q4: Can you push an image to multiple registries?

Yes, tag the image for each registry and push separately.
