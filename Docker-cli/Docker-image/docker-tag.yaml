🔹 1. Basic Definition

docker image tag is used to create a new tag for an existing Docker image.

Think of it as labeling the same image with a different name or version.

Tagging does not create a new image; it just gives another reference to the same image ID.

---
🔹 2. Basic Syntax

docker image tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] → existing image you want to tag

TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG] → new name or version you want to assign

If TAG is omitted, Docker defaults to latest.

---
🔹 3. Aliases

There is no shorter alias specifically for tagging; the command is always:

docker image tag

---
🔹 4. Basic Example

Suppose you have an image ubuntu:20.04 and you want to give it a new tag myubuntu:v1:

docker image tag ubuntu:20.04 myubuntu:v1

Check with:

docker images

Output might look like:

REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID
ubuntu        20.04     7e0aa2d69a15
myubuntu      v1        7e0aa2d69a15

✅ Notice that both tags point to the same IMAGE ID.

---
🔹 5. Parameters / Options

This command is very straightforward and doesn’t have many options:

Option	Description

None	Just specify source and target

Tagging is lightweight because it doesn’t duplicate image data. It’s just creating a new reference.

---
🔹 6. Different Examples

🧠 Example 1: Tag by image name

docker image tag nginx mynginx:prod

Renames nginx image to mynginx with tag prod.

---
🧠 Example 2: Tag by image ID

docker images

# IMAGE ID  SHA256:abc123

docker image tag abc123 myapp:latest

---
🧠 Example 3: Tag for Docker registry

docker image tag myapp:latest docker.io/myusername/myapp:v2

Prepares image for pushing to Docker Hub or other registries.

---
🧠 Example 4: Multiple tags for same image

docker image tag myapp:latest myapp:1.0

docker image tag myapp:latest myapp:stable

Useful for versioning and CI/CD pipelines.

---
🔹 7. How It Works Internally

Docker identifies the IMAGE ID of the SOURCE_IMAGE.

Creates a new reference (tag) in Docker’s metadata for the same IMAGE ID.

No new layers or disk space are consumed.

Both tags now reference the same underlying image layers.
